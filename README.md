# Cryptobreaker
Cryptography tools provided by a GUI interface created in python with tkinter  
  
Dependencies:  
* tkinter  
* matplotlib  
* python 3.x
  
Current decryption tools supported:  
* Frequency Analysis  
* Index of coincidence  
* Probable key length calculator (for polyalphabetic ciphers)  
* Caesar shift  
* Affine shift  
* Column transposition  
* Railfence cipher  
* Keyword substitution cipher  
* Vigenere cipher  
* Polyalphabetic affine cipher  
* Beaufort cipher (including german variant)  
* Autokey/Autoclave cipher  
* Playfair cipher  
  
Most ciphers include a dictionary bruteforce option. Caesar and affine include a normal bruteforce.  
  
More ciphers to be addded soon. I have programmed some more but have not implememnted them to my GUI yet.  
I have also programmed a semi-automatic vigenere cipher breaker which I am currently implementing.
